# Community Culture

tscircuit acts as a steward for ai-enabled tsx electronics engineering. As a steward,
we take care of this vision by making sure that our work and culture is self-sustaining
and maximally impactful.

We believe that great work can come from anywhere from motivated people. We want to enable
people who love to build to do their best work.

## Being a Great tscircuit Engineer

- **autonomous** - You find bugs and judge the quality of your work well. You have personal
  projects that guide your work and motivate you to make the project better
- **rock solid** - You know how to create tests for your work, and create visual snapshots
  so that nobody breaks it in the future.
- **clear and concise** - You think carefully about APIs and variable names. Every line of
  code has a 10 year lifespan, and you name things to be clear to every developer who
  stumbles upon it

### Things to Avoid

- Asking someone to create an issue for you (poor self-management)


## The Company

tscircuit is also a venture-backed company with mission-aligned investors. We're all on
the same team to make sure we deploy resources to accelerate our mission.

Many companies start with an open-source core and add cloud services where appropriate to
increase the value of the core offering. Vercel created NextJS, then sold cloud services.
tscircuit is similar in that we release a compelling open-source offering that can be
used anywhere, but then offer cloud services via the `tscircuit.com` website, such as
connecting projects to GitHub and automatically building them on the cloud.

A committment to open-source means you won't capture all the value you create. We expect
people to build incredible businesses that make lots of money without ever paying tscircuit
a cent. We also expect businesses will choose our integrated cloud offerings with the
trust we've earned by building great tools.
